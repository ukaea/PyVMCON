    Parameters
    ----------
    problem : AbstractProblem
        Defines the system to be minimised

    x : ndarray
        The initial starting `x` of VMCON

    lbs : ndarray
        Lower bounds of `x`. If `None`, no lower bounds are applied

    ubs : ndarray
        Upper bounds of `x`. If `None`, no upper bounds are applied

    max_iter : int
        The maximum iterations of VMCON before an exception is raised

    epsilon : float
        The tolerance used to test if VMCON has converged

    qsp_options : Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        Dictionary of keyword arguments that are passed to the
        CVXPY `Probelem.solve` method. `None` will pass no
        additional arguments to the solver.

    initial_B : ndarray
        Initial estimate of the Hessian matrix `B`. If `None`, `B` is the
        identity matrix of shape `(max(n,m), max(n,m))`.

    callback : Optional[Callable[[int, np.ndarray, Result], None]]
        A callable which takes the current iteration, current design point,
        the `Result` of the current design point, and the convergence parameter
        as arguments and returns `None`. This callable is called each iteration
        after the QSP is solved but before the convergence test.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        The solution vector which VMCON converges to.

    lamda_equality : ndarray
        The Lagrange multipliers for the equality constraints at the solution vector.

    lamda_inequality : ndarray
        The Lagrange multipliers for the inequality constraints at the solution vector.

    result : Result
        The result from running the solution vector through the problem.
